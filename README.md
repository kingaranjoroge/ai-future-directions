# AI Future Directions Assignment

## Overview
In this repository are complete deliverables for the AI Future Directions assignment, covering fields including theoretical analysis, practical implementation, a futuristic AI proposal, and a quantum simulation bonus. The work is organized into clearly structured Markdown files and executable code for easy review and reproducibility.

## File Structure
- `Theoretical_Analysis.md` — Academic answers to theoretical questions and a smart city case study critique (Chunk 1)
- `Practical_Implementation.md` — Edge AI prototype report, smart agriculture concept (with diagram), and ethics in personalized medicine (Chunk 2)
- `Futuristic_Proposal.md` — 1-page concept paper for a bold AI application in 2030 (Chunk 3)
- `Quantum_Simulation.md` — Quantum circuit code, explanation, and AI use case (Chunk 4, Bonus)
- `Practical_Implementation.ipynb` — Jupyter notebook with executable code for the Edge AI image classification prototype
- `Quantam_Simulation.ipynb` — Jupyter notebook with executable code for the quantum simulation (Bell state circuit)
- `README.md` — This file

## Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb Files)

This repository includes two Jupyter notebook files for hands-on demonstration and reproducibility:

- **Practical_Implementation.ipynb**: Contains all code cells for the Edge AI image classification prototype as described in Practical_Implementation.md. You can run this notebook to train, convert, and test the model, and view outputs directly.
- **Quantam_Simulation.ipynb**: Contains the Qiskit code for simulating the Bell state quantum circuit, as described in Quantum_Simulation.md. Run this notebook to simulate and visualize quantum entanglement results.

**How to Use:**
1. Open the notebooks in Jupyter Notebook, JupyterLab, or Google Colab.
2. Run the cells in order to reproduce the results and visualizations.
3. (Optionally) Add markdown explanations, comments, or outputs as needed.
4. Submit these notebooks along with the Markdown files for a complete, executable submission.

## How to Run the Code

### Edge AI Prototype (Practical_Implementation.md or Practical_Implementation.ipynb)
- The code is provided both in the Markdown file and as a ready-to-run Jupyter notebook.
- It uses TensorFlow and demonstrates training, conversion to TensorFlow Lite, and simulated inference for an image classification task.
- To run:
  1. Open `Practical_Implementation.ipynb` and run each cell in order. Adjust the dataset as needed for your use case.

### Quantum Simulation (Quantum_Simulation.md or Quantam_Simulation.ipynb)
- The Qiskit code is provided both in the Markdown file and as a ready-to-run Jupyter notebook.
- To run:
  1. Open `Quantam_Simulation.ipynb` and run each cell to simulate and visualize the Bell state circuit.

## Submission Guidelines
- **Code & Diagrams:** All code and diagrams are included in the Markdown files and Jupyter notebooks, ready for upload to GitHub.
- **Written Report:** The Markdown files can be exported as PDF or submitted directly as part of your coursework.
- **Presentation Deck:** Use the content from each section to create a peer-review pitch or business value presentation as required.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook (for code execution)
- TensorFlow (for Edge AI prototype)
- Qiskit (for quantum simulation)
